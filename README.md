# (Modified) Slingshot Effect Simulation

Based on the following repo:
https://github.com/techwithtim/Slingshot-Effect-Simulation

My modification added a "press-and-release" mechanism to firing the "spaceship" or moving object in space to exploit the gravitational pull of the planet to generated the "slingshot effect" to increase its velocity while altering its trajectory.
